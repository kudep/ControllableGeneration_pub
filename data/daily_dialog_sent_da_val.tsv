There are many customers here . EOS Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . EOS Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? EOS That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .

EOS Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . EOS You mean to saya EOS It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? EOS We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .	All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .	2	3

Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith .	Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .	3	1

EOS Do you keep a stock of these things ? EOS In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . EOS That is , your commission . EOS Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . EOS Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . EOS The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . EOS According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? EOS We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . EOS We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... EOS Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? EOS Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . EOS Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . EOS Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .	Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?	2	2

If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .	2	1

Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .	3	1

If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . EOS Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? EOS Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . EOS I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?	Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .	2	3

Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . EOS Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .	In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .	3	1

Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . EOS Good morning . EOS Would you like something to drink ? EOS No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . EOS So , you're a serious coffee drinker . EOS Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . EOS Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?

EOS Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . EOS What do you suggest ? EOS The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . EOS You mean because people have to go across town to get here . EOS Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . EOS That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . EOS I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . EOS I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . EOS Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . EOS Well . EOS I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . EOS You mean you want to run the meetings ? EOS No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . EOS Hmm .

EOS I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? EOS What seems to be the problem ?	It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .	2	1

So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... EOS We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...	That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .	2	1

Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .	3	1
