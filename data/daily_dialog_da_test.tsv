EOS My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . EOS I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? EOS Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . EOS You need a babysitter . EOS Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . EOS I could have Suzy stay at my place . EOS I don't want to do that to you , Karen . EOS Why not ? EOS Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . EOS I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .	I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .	1

So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...	No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO - the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .	1

If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .	1

Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ' s OK . EOS Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ' t go into detail , but it wasn ' t serious . EOS I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . EOS I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . EOS It must have really hurt afterwards . EOS Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ' t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . EOS I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . EOS I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ' t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! EOS Is there any pain now ? EOS No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . EOS Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?	Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .	1
How was the party ?	I had a fantastic time .	1

EOS I think my arm is broken . EOS Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . EOS Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . EOS Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . EOS I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? EOS Alright . EOS It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . EOS Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . EOS Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . EOS Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . EOS It really hurts . EOS Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? EOS To hell with you . The accident was your fault . EOS I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?	To hell with you .	1

It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .

EOS The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .	Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .	1

I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . EOS It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .	Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !	1

EOS hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . EOS exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... EOS yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! EOS why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . EOS are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? EOS never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? EOS yeah , I think so . EOS ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .	wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .	1
